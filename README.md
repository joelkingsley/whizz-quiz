12th standard CBSE final project using Turbo C++

The MAIN.CPP source file must me compiled using Turbo C++ inorder to build the 16-bit executable file. In computers running on 32-bit or 64-bit operating systems(most new operating systems), the executable can be run only by using DOSBOX emulator.

Note: A portable version of this program is being developed, which will be able to run in modern compilers.
